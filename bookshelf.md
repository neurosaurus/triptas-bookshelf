#Tripta's Bookshelf

I came across a few reading lists on github (see [here](https://github.com/coryschires/reading-list) & [here](https://github.com/DavidRagone/reading_list)) and felt inspired to start my own. I've started to read some amazing books revolving around UX, development, and open science and want to keep a public archive of information I've found useful in each one. Hopefully someone finds it valuable.

I'll aim to include the following:  

- A short synopsis of the book
- Highlights/quotes from the book
- Links to any follow-up [blog](http://triptagupta.tumblr.com/) posts that I write
- Books I've read and want to read
- Any relevant links related to topics covered in the books
